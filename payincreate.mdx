###  Pay-In Create Order

The ** Pay-In Create Order** endpoint allows clients to initiate a pay-in (deposit) request to the Finflex system. This is the reverse of a payout (withdrawal) and is used to collect money from users. 

This endpoint supports two methods of authentication:  
- **Client Credentials** using the `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` headers.  
- **Bearer Token** via the `Authorization` header.  

You only need to use **one** of these authentication methods.
